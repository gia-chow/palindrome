# palindrome checker
A JavaScript module that checks whether a string is palindrome.

A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or elements that reads the same forward or reversed, with general allowances for adjustments to punctuation and word dividers. Famous examples include "Amor, Roma", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" and "No 'x' in 'Nixon'".
